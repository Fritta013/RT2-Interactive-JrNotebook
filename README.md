#  Interaction with UI.py using JupyterNotebook

This project is the second assignment for Research Track 1. It is a simulation of a motion planning of a mobile robot in an environment. Additionally, with the use of jupyternotebook the user can control the motion of the robot. In addition, a visualization of the robot movement along with the target position will be plotted. For the user to view the distance of the obstacle from the robot, he/she can click on the button "display distance". A bar plot is also available to compare the number of goals achieved vs the number of goals cancelled. For further details scroll down, please. 

It is important to note that the user can interact with the robot using jupyter notebook while also being able to set target positions for the robot to reach similarly in Research Track assignment 2.
